# PHS106
This repository contains programs of a Physics Course, PHS106. C and MATLAB/Octave is used to solve the problems. We will use ```gnuplot``` for plotting and ```gcc``` as C compiler.

## Syllabus

### Programs

* Sum & Avarage of a list of numbers.
* Largest of a given list of numbers and it's location in the list.
* Sorting of number in ascending, descending order.
* Binary Search
* Area of circle
* Are of square
* Volume of square
* Volume of pi.
* Solution of Linear and Quadratic Equation
* Evaluation of trigonometric function eg. sin(x), cos(x), tan(x)

### Application to Physics

* Radioactive Decay
* Current in RC, LC Circuit with DC
* Newton's Law of Cooling
* Classical Equation of Motion
* The differential equation describing the motion of a pendulum
d^2(theta)/dt^2 = -sin(x) The pendulam is released from rest at an angular displacement a i.e. theta(0) = alpha, theta'(0) = 0. Solve the equation alpha = 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 and plot theta as a function of time in the range 0 <= t <= 8*pi. Also plot the analytic solution valid for theta, sin(theta).
