# PHS106
This repository contains programs of a Physics Course, PHS106. C and MATLAB/Octave is used to solve the problems. We will use ```gnuplot``` for plotting.

## Syllabus

### Programs

* Sum & Avarage of a list of numbers.
* Largest of a given list of numbers and it's location in the list.
* Sorting of number in ascending, descending order.
* Binary Search
* Area of circle
* Are of square
* Volume of square
* Volume of pi $\pi$
* Solution of Linear and Quadratic Equation
* Evaluation of trigonometric function eg. $\sin{\theta}, \cos{\theta}, \tan{\theta}$

### Application to Physics

* Radioactive Decay
* Current in RC, LC Circuit with DC
* Newton's Law of Cooling
* Classical Equation of Motion
* The differential equation describing the motion of a pendulum
$\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = -\sin{\theta}$ The pendulam is released from rest at an angular displacement $\alpha$ i.e. $\theta(0) = \alpha$, $\theta'(0) = 0$. Solve the equation $\alpha = 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0$ and plot $\theta$ as a function of time in the range $0 \leq t \leq 8\pi$. Also plot the analytic solution valid for $\theta$, $\sin{\theta}=0$
